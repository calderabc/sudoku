** To build first try running the relevant build script (it may work):
build_gcc.sh
build_ming.sh
configure_vs.bat
build_vs.bat


** Building with Visual Studio:

Install cmake by browsing to www.cmake.org and downloading and
running the Win32 Installer.

To configure to build in Visual Studio first run 'configure_vs.bat'
from Visual Studio's Developer Command Prompt (requires nmake.exe
in the executable path).  This will build the required
library pdcurses then create the Visual Studio project file
'sudoku.vcxproj'. Build and run by opening with Visual Studio.

I'm not sure what the 'BUILD_ALL' and 'ZERO_CHECK' projects generated
by cmake are for.  Sometimes they cause conflict when trying to
run the debugger.  I still need to do more research.  They can be
removed.

Alternatively build from the Developer Command Prompt (requires
MSBuild.exe) with:
  build_vs.bat
    or
  MSBuild.exe sudoku.vcxproj

To execute from command line go to the sudoku base directory then:
  Debug\sudoku.exe

# TODO: Add code to install the program and build executable which
# isn't the Debug version.


** Building in Linux:

Requires cmake and the wide character ncurses development library.
To install in Ubuntu:
  apt-get install cmake libncursesw5-dev
  (or aptitude command)

Other linux distributions should have as well.
# TODO: Research what package to install in other distros.)

From the shell prompt go to the 'sudoku' directory and
create the makefiles for make:
  cmake .

Build:
  make

# TODO: Add 'make install' capability.

The sudoku executable is generated in the "build" directory.
"file.sdk" (copied to "build") needs to be in current directory when executing.
# TODO: Improve data file referencing in source code. Maybe use
# a config file.

Execute:
  cd build
  ./sudoku


** Building in Cygwin:

Requires cmake and the wide character ncurses development library.
Install by running the Cygwin install application 'setup.exe'.
In 'Select Packages' search for for 'ncursesw' then 'cmake'
install the packages 'libncursesw-devel' and 'cmake'.

For everything else follow the Linux build instructions.
